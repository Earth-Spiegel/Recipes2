    <p><strong>"The</strong> transforming furikake rice is a <em>delicious</em> Japanese dish where the eggs transform
    when the gelatinized cubes of flavor melt.</p>
    <p>This dish is found in Food Wars, or <em>Shokugeki no Soma</em>, season 1, episode 2, and is made by Soma.</p>
    <p>Preparing this dish will leave your friends amazed and waiting for the recipe.</p>
    <p><strong>You</strong> will need several locally found ingredients. However if you can't find sake in your local grocery store,</p>
    <p>you will have to go to an Asian grocery store.</p>
    <p><strong>The</strong> sesame oil will give this delicious meal an amazing nutty aroma.</p>
    <p>Do not be shy with the ginger and the garlic. The <em>more</em>, the <em>better</em>.</p>
    <p>Cook the spring onion with butter before you add it to the eggs during garnishing. This will taste better.</p>
    <p><strong>Serve it hot and watch the cubes <em>melt</em>.</strong></p>
    <p>Enjoy!<strong>"</strong></p>

        <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> of sake</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add sesame oil to a pan and heat to medium. Fry the chicken wings for <strong>10-15 minutes</strong>, or until golden brown. Save the chicken residue in the pan.</li>
        <li>Add water and soup stock to a pot and heat to a boil. Add the chicken and turn the broth down to a medium-low.</li>
        <li>Add the ginger, soy sauce, sake, and sugar to the chicken pan. Stir all of these ingredients with a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Pour everything from the pan into the broth. Simmer on medium-low for <strong>20 minutes</strong>.</li>
        <li>Take the broth off the heat and let it sit for a <strong>few minutes</strong>. If there is a layer of fat on top, take it off. Take the chicken wings out and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the gelatine to 1/2 of water and let bloom for <strong>5 minutes</strong>. Mix the gelatine into the water until fully dissolved. Add the gelatine mix to the broth mix.</li>
        <li>Grease tray with butter. Add the broth. Cover with cling wrap, put in the fridge, and let it solidify for <strong>2 hours</strong>.</li>
        <li>Separate the chicken from the bones and skin. Add the chicken to the rice, unless you want the recipe to be <em>exactly</em> like Food Wars (<em>Shokugeki no Soma</em>).</li>
        <li>Take the gelatin broth out of the fridge and cut into small cubes of broth gelatin.</li>
        <li>Scramble eggs. Add eggs and chopped green onions to rice. Add the aspic (meat broth jelly).</li>
        <li><strong>Most Important Step</strong>: Watch the cubes <em>melt</em> and enjoy!</li>
