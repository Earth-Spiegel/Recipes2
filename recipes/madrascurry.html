    <p><strong><em>"Who</em></strong> doesn't like super tender beef in rich tomato-based curry sauce?</p>
    <p>It melts in the mouth and is super easy to prepare! I have separated the process of cooking as most online recipes call for,</p>
    <p>this gives more control over meat tenderness and the right consistency of the sauce,</p>
    <p>just like in the restaurant setting, brining the best quality to your home cooking :)<strong><em>"</em></strong></p>

        <li><strong>1 Tbsp</strong> of ginger & garlic paste</li>
        <li><strong>1 Tbsp</strong> of vegetable oil</li>
        <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> of salt</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients for the Madras Spice Blend</h2>

        <li><strong>2 Tbsp</strong> garam masala</li>

    <h2>Ingredients for the Curry</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>500g</strong> of marinated Beef</li>
        <li><strong>4 Tbsp</strong> tomato puree</li>
        <li><strong>3 Tbsp</strong> of Madras Spice Blend</li>
        <li><strong>2 Tbsp</strong> of ghee or vegetable oil</li>
        <li><strong>1 Tbsp</strong> of ginger & garlic paste</li>
        <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> of sugar</li>
        <li><strong>400ml</strong> of vegetable stock</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> beef stock cube</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> large onion, small dice</li>
        <li>Juice of half a lemon</li>
        <li>A handful of fresh coriander leaves and seeds</li>
        <li>Papadam to serve</li>
        <li>Enough water to cover the meat during slow-cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Madras spice blend by mixing the ingredients. It will make more than you need for the recipe (you can always add more at the end of cooking to boost the flavour)</li>
        <li>Place the beef in the bowl and marinate by mixing all the ingredients from the list with the meat. Place in the fridge overnight.</li>
        <li>On the following day, sear the beef in a frying pan over high heat and transfer it to a slow-cooker or a pot (do not over-fry it as it will make your meat dry, you want a nice carmelization
            on one side of each piece). Add enough hot water to cover the meat and cook covered on low until tender. This can take 2-3 hours depending on the cut used (a slow cooker can take longer)
        </li>
        <li>In the meantime prepare the sauce. In a medium-sized pan heat <strong>2 tbsp</strong> of ghee or vegetable oil, add diced onion and fry over medium heat until soft and browned.</li>
        <li>Add <strong>1 tbsp</strong> of ginger garlic paste, <strong>3 tbsp</strong> of Madras spice blend, and cook until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add vegetable stock, tomato puree, beef stock cube, <strong>1 tsp</strong> sugar, and lemon juice. Mix together and bring to a boil. Blend sauce and adjust seasoning to your preference, remove from the heat until needed.</li>
        <li>Once the beef is tender and connective tissue has turned to jelly, separate it from the liquid. Add beef to the sauce plus a little bit of the cooking stock.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking on low heat until the thick consistency of the sauce is reached.</li>
        <li>Serve Beef Madras with fresh coriander seeds and leaves. Crunch with papadam, cucumber raita and onion salad. Enjoy!</li>
